Instead of using generic phrases like \"Click Here\" or \"Read More,\" use specific language such as \"Download the 2023 Annual Report.\"​In addition to being descriptive, link text should also be concise. Aim to convey the necessary information without being overly verbose. ​Ensure that hyperlinks are visually distinct from the surrounding text. Typically, links are underlined, and a different color is used to indicate that they are clickable.​"

Screen readers can read the title, author, and even keywords, giving users a roadmap of what to expect. This is particularly helpful for lengthy documents or when users need to navigate between multiple documents within a collection, like a course folder.Search and Discovery for Assistive TechnologiesMany assistive technologies allow users to search for specific information within their digital environment. Descriptive document metadata acts like keywords, improving the discoverability of your documents. For instance, a student searching for a report on \"Social Media Marketing\" might find your document much faster if the title and keywords within the metadata accurately reflect the content.​Reduced Reliance on Visual CuesUsers with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities might struggle to interpret visual cues like document titles displayed on screen. Metadata provides an alternative way to access this essential information through screen readers or assistive technologies, promoting independent access to document content.​"

While PDFs offer advantages like portability and consistent formatting, they can create barriers for users with disabilities if not exported correctly. Inaccessible PDFs can be difficult for screen readers to navigate, and users might lose access to essential information within the document.The key to creating accessible PDFs lies in the document \"tags,\" which act as behind-the-scenes instructions within the PDF that describe the document's structure and content.

Some online conversion services or third-party tools can analyze and improve the accessibility of the documents before exporting them to PDF. However, it is important to remember that creating a well-structured document from the beginning is always the ideal approach, as it ensures accessibility from the ground up.Previewing Your PDFAfter exporting your document, it is a good practice to preview the PDF using Adobe Acrobat Reader or a screen reader to test its accessibility. This allows you to identify any potential issues before sharing the document with others. Think of it as a final quality check! By testing the document yourself, you can ensure it functions as intended for users with assistive technologies.Additional ConsiderationsWhen exporting, ensure \"Reflow with Tagged PDF\" is selected. This creates a tagged PDF structure, allowing screen readers to effectively navigate headings, content, and tables.Review and edit the document properties within the PDF settings. This process is similar to editing document metadata in Word. Ensure that the title, author, and subject accurately reflect the content.WCAG ConsiderationsWCAG offers a few more guidelines that are relevant to accessible PDFs.WCAG 1.1.1 - Non-text Content emphasizes providing alternative text descriptions for non-text content, such as images and charts. This ensures that users who rely on screen readers can understand the information conveyed by these elements within the PDF.WCAG 2.4.1 - Bypass Blocks encourages providing ways to skip repetitive blocks of content, like navigation menus or headers, using keyboard shortcuts or other assistive technologies. While not always applicable to simple PDFs, this becomes important for complex documents with repeated content sections."
