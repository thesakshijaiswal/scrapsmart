        "Handling customers’ needs through chat has some clear advantages, including the ability to assist in real time and offer a quick resolution. However, some challenges can arise when managing multiple chat conversations simultaneously.  In this module, you will learn how “multitasking” affects the brain, and some best practices to get the most out of situations when you must work on multiple tasks."

        "Multitasking is Task-Switching",
        "Has anyone ever bragged to you about how good they are at multitasking? Or has someone in a job interview asked you to rate your ability to multitask? At times, we all do what is referred to as “multitasking” without even realizing it. Do you ever watch TV and browse the internet at the same time, or respond to emails while listening to a podcast? Recent studies prove that multitasking is a myth, with many reporting a decrease of up to 40% in productivity in addition to diminished cognitive memory and creativity. The reality is that multitasking is not truly attainable. When we engage in multiple tasks at once, our brain is actually switching between the tasks, focusing on one task at a time. As we switch back and forth quickly, it gives the illusion of multitasking. Many people have moved past the word “multitasking” and instead use the term “task-switching.”  It can be a challenge to remain self-aware of the diminishing returns caused by task-switching. When we complete a task, our brain sends signals that make us feel happy, positive, and motivated. That rush encourages us to take on more, and it creates a vicious cycle of task-switching. This effect on the brain is the same whether we’re working on complicated tasks, such as surgery or flying a plane, or simple tasks like scrolling through social media or cooking.  Neuroscience studies have measured cognitive strain while task-switching. Our brain has inhibitors that block out unnecessary background noises and distractions. But task-switching overwhelms those inhibitors so that they’re unable to filter out distractions. This adds a level of cognitive overload and stress that we don’t experience when we’re limited to a single task.  Some argue that younger generations can handle task-switching due to being born in a society overflowing with technology. But mental health surveys, in conjunction with the scientific research around task-switching, suggest otherwise. According to these studies, the cognitive strain of task-switching leads to added stress in any person’s life. Task-switching is inevitable to a certain degree. As a customer service agent, being asked to manage multiple digital conversations simultaneously (often in a multichannel environment) is normal. But you can better manage task-switching when you apply some best practices. Batch your work. Remove distractions. Organize your activities. Take advantage of technology. These are a few of the ideas this lesson will explore to help you succeed while task-switching. Productive task-switching may sound like an “X-factor\" skill. In reality, it is a myth. We can, however, change our habits to maximize our efforts. Take a deep breath, prioritize the tasks at hand, and feel the calmness replace the chaos. Your brain will thank you—and so will your customers. Select “Skip Video” to proceed."

        "Neuroscience has been able to pinpoint what parts of the brain are affected by task-switching. Through this research, we can determine where in the brain cognitive fatigue is taking place and to what degree. Select the four hotspots on the brain to learn more about how each part reacts to task-switching. When finished, select “Next” to continue. "

        "You’ll now put the task-switching theory to the test. First, you’ll answer the following simple math equations to establish a baseline. Next, you’ll repeat the process but with added instructions and distractions. Finally, you’ll reflect on a few questions and observations.  This activity is just for fun. There are no grades or reporting, and there are no mandatory benchmarks to hit. The purpose is to demonstrate the effects of task-switching in an enjoyable way. Have fun and participate fully to see the impact of task-switching. Note: Navigation using \"Previous\" and \"Next\" will remain disabled during this activity. Select “Start” when you are ready to begin. After completing the ten questions, select “Finish.”"
